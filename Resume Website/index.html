            Hello! My name is John Shenk. I am currently a student at Millersville University. <br>
            This is a test website that I will be upgrading as I learn more things in CSCI 421 - Web Development!<br>
        </p>

        <h2>A Little Bit About Myself</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Millersville university senior who has found out they find web development interesting and<br>
            is considering pursuing a career as a web developer. My favorite activities include playing video games,<br>
            playing tabletop games, coding, and drawing! I like working with computers and have a newfound interest in<br>
            web development. If you would like to view more information about me please follow the links above.<br>
            Alternatively, you can find a copy of my resume <a href="Documents/John's Resume.pdf" target ="_blank">here</a>.<br>
            (Depending on how far along this website is coming along, it might be best to just download the pdf).
